MikMod 2.09 Beta compilation notes
==================================

With this portable version of mikmod I moved all makefiles for every
system/compiler to seperate directories (in MIKM209B\SOURCE):

BORLAND : project files to compile mikmod for DOS real mode, using BC 3.1
WIN95   : driver + IDE files to compile mikmod for Windows'95, using BC 4.5
LINUX   : sources + makefile to compile mikmod for Linux, using GNU-C
WATCOM  : makefile to compile mikmod for DOS protected mode, using Watcom C

To compile mikmod to one of those targets, just copy the files in that
specific directory one directory below (to the SOURCE directory).

Then, go to the source directory (if you weren't already) and run MAKE,
WMAKE, BC, or whatever is appropriate.
