License Terms:                   
==============

        
- You only have to register if you're planning on using mikmod commercially. 
In this context I define commercial as 'you're getting money for the product 
you're using mikmod for'. This _includes_ compilation cd-roms & magazines.


- Registering MikMod is for binaries only. You're not allowed to distribute
the MikMod sources or parts of it in _any_ form. If you do want distribute
the sources on a commercial basis, you'll need special permission of the
author (Jean-Paul Mikkers).


- Registering MikMod gives you the right to sell an unlimited number of 
copies of the product you're using it for.


- Registering MikMod 2.xx means that you're registering all versions of 
MikMod between 2.00 and any updates upto version 2.99. This allows for
bugfixes and updates without the need to register again.


- A MikMod registration cannot be transferred from one person to another, or
from one person to a company, or from one company to another company.


- You don't get any disks, or printed manuals when registering. You can 
always get the latest version or updates via Email.
